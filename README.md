In this repository are descriptions and files of the work I did at the MIT Aerospace Controls Lab in the summer of 2023.

## **Drone Antenna Holder:**
  The Drone Antenna Holder is a two piece clamp that attached to the propeller gaurd of a hexacopter to hold radio antennas.
The two parts of the antenna holder are held together by two zipties.

## **Drone Sensor Mount:**
  The Drone Sensor Holder mounts internally in the hexicopter and holds six NoopLoop Ultrawideband (UWB) sensors. These sensors connect via SMA cables to the antennas mounted on the propeller gaurds. It also contains a rectangular slot to hold usb hubs into which the UWB sensors plug.

## **Drone Spacer:**
  The Drone Spacer is designed to seperate the top and bottom caarbon fiber plates in the drone so there is space for the circuitry.
