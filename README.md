# MIT-ACL-Internship
In this repository are descriptions and files of the work I did at the MIT Aerospace Controls Lab in the summer of 2023.

## **Drone Antenna Holder:**
  The Drone Antenna Holder is a two piece clamp that attached to the propeller gaurd of a hexacopter to hold radio antennas.
The two parts of the antenna holder are held together by a ziptie.

## **Drone Sensor Mount:**
  The Drone Sensor Holder mounts internally in the hexicopter and holds six NoopLoop Ultrawideband sensors. These sensors connect via SMA cables to the antennas mounted on the propeller gaurds.

## **Drone Spacer:**
  The Drone Spacer is designed to seperate the top and bottom caarbon fiber plates in the drone so there is space for the circuitry.
