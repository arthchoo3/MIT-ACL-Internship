In this repository are descriptions and files of the work I did at the MIT Aerospace Controls Lab in the summer of 2023.

## **Drone Antenna Holder:**
  The Drone Antenna Holder is a two piece clamp that attached to the propeller gaurd of a hexacopter to hold radio antennas.
The two parts of the antenna holder are held together by two zipties.

## **Drone Sensor Mount:**
  The Drone Sensor Holder mounts internally in the hexicopter and holds six NoopLoop Ultrawideband (UWB) sensors. These sensors connect via SMA cables to the antennas mounted on the propeller gaurds. It also contains a rectangular slot to hold usb hubs into which the UWB sensors plug.

## **Drone Spacer:**
  The Drone Spacer is designed to seperate the top and bottom caarbon fiber plates in the drone so there is space for the circuitry.

## **Cube Experiment**
  The Motion Capture (MoCap) space in the ACL only permits the flight of drones up to a certain size due to safety regulations. However, we aimed to test our research on large scale drones. To simulate the positioning of the UWB sensors on a larger drone, we build PVC cubes on which we mounted the UWB sensors. The positioning of the UWB sensors on these PVC cubes exactly matched that of a drone our supervisor tested in an outdoor flight space in California--allowing us to have data from true flight conditions as well as high precision MoCap data.

## **PVC Turtlebot Drones**
  Adding the UWB sensors to the drones made them heavier than normal thus decleasing their flight time. In order to collect larger amounts of continuous flowing data, we build PVC drones the exact size as our drones to simulate the UWB's relative positions. Placing these PVC drones on TurtleBots allowed us to "fly" for longer and collect more continuous data. It also eliminated the risk of drone and sensor damage due to a drone crash. We also built one of the PVC drones to be higher of the ground to simulate altitude varience.
